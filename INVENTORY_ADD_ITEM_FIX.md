# Inventory "Add Item" Feature - Fix Summary

## Problem
The "Add Item" buttons in the Inventory page were non-functional stubs with no onClick handlers or dialog implementation.

## Solution
Created a fully functional "Add Inventory Item" dialog with comprehensive form fields and integrated it with the existing backend API.

## Changes Made

### 1. Created AddInventoryItemDialog Component
**File:** `/frontend/src/components/inventory/AddInventoryItemDialog.tsx`

A comprehensive dialog form with the following sections:

#### Basic Information
- Item Name (required)
- Type: MEDICINE, EQUIPMENT, SUPPLY, CONSUMABLE (required)
- Description
- Generic Name
- Brand Name
- Category
- Sub-Category
- Manufacturer
- Supplier

#### Identification
- Barcode
- SKU (Stock Keeping Unit)

#### Pricing
- Cost Price (required)
- Selling Price (required)
- MRP (Maximum Retail Price)

#### Unit & Packaging
- Unit (required): PIECES, BOXES, BOTTLES, STRIPS, TUBES, VIALS, AMPOULES, SYRINGES, PACKS, KITS
- Pack Size
- Pack Unit

#### Stock Levels
- Min Stock Level
- Max Stock Level
- Reorder Level
- Reorder Quantity

#### Additional Details
- Batch Number
- Expiry Date
- HSN Code (for GST)
- GST Rate (%)
- Storage Location
- Storage Conditions
- Requires Prescription (checkbox)
- Controlled Substance (checkbox)

### 2. Updated Inventory Page
**File:** `/frontend/src/app/dashboard/inventory/page.tsx`

- Added state management for the dialog (`showAddDialog`)
- Wired up both "Add Item" buttons to open the dialog
- Connected the dialog's `onSuccess` callback to refresh the inventory list

### 3. Created Checkbox UI Component
**File:** `/frontend/src/components/ui/checkbox.tsx`

- Created a reusable Checkbox component using Radix UI primitives
- Follows the existing UI component pattern in the project
- Installed `@radix-ui/react-checkbox` package

## Backend Integration
The dialog integrates with the existing backend API:
- **Endpoint:** `POST /inventory/items`
- **Service:** `InventoryService.createInventoryItem()`
- **Validation:** Uses DTOs with class-validator decorators

## Features
- ✅ Comprehensive form with all inventory item fields
- ✅ Client-side validation for required fields
- ✅ Proper type conversion (strings to numbers/dates)
- ✅ Loading states and error handling
- ✅ Success callback to refresh inventory list
- ✅ Form reset after successful submission
- ✅ Responsive layout with organized sections
- ✅ Accessible form labels and inputs

## Testing
To test the feature:

1. Navigate to the Inventory page (`/dashboard/inventory`)
2. Click either "Add Item" button (in header or empty state)
3. Fill in the required fields:
   - Item Name
   - Type
   - Cost Price
   - Selling Price
   - Unit
4. Optionally fill in additional fields
5. Click "Add Item" to create the inventory item
6. The inventory list will refresh and show the new item

## Notes
- The backend API already existed and was fully functional
- Initial stock is set to 0 by the backend
- Stock status is automatically set to OUT_OF_STOCK for new items
- Use the Stock Adjustment feature to add initial stock after creating an item
