## Business Rules Implemented

### Visit Creation
1. **Patient Validation**: Patient must exist and belong to the branch
2. **Doctor Validation**: Doctor must exist, be active, and belong to the branch
3. **Appointment Validation**: If appointment is provided, it must exist and match patient/doctor
4. **Complaints Required**: At least one complaint must be provided
5. **Conflict Prevention**: Only one visit per appointment allowed

### Visit Updates
1. **JSON Serialization**: Complex objects are stored as JSON strings for efficiency
2. **Partial Updates**: Only provided fields are updated
3. **Data Integrity**: All updates maintain data integrity

### Visit Completion
1. **Status Update**: Linked appointment status changes to COMPLETED
2. **Follow-up Planning**: Optional follow-up date and instructions
3. **Final Documentation**: Completion notes are added

### Visit Deletion
1. **Soft Delete**: Visits are not physically deleted
2. **Prescription Check**: Cannot delete visits with associated prescriptions
3. **Audit Trail**: Deletion is marked in notes field
