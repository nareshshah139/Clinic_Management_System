### September 2025: Appointments End-to-End Workflow Validation
**Achievement:** Completed full E2E validation of the Appointments workflow across backend and frontend.
**Impact:**
- Frontend `AppointmentScheduler.tsx` aligned with backend responses; now uses `firstName`/`lastName`, `date`+`slot`, and `availableSlots` arrays of strings.
- Enabled global `ValidationPipe({ transform: true, whitelist: true })` so `limit`/`page` are coerced to numbers; users listing works reliably.
- Updated Appointments DTOs to accept string IDs (cuid) instead of UUIDs for `doctorId`, `patientId`, and `roomId`.
- Fixed `reports.dto.ts` compilation issues and startup errors.
- Added `backend/scripts/seed.ts` to create seed branch, doctor, receptionist, patient, and room.

**Tested (manual E2E via HTTP):**
- JWT login (receptionist) -> list doctors -> `GET /appointments/available-slots` -> `POST /appointments` -> `GET /appointments` -> `POST /appointments/:id/reschedule` (2 days out to respect 24h rule) -> `DELETE /appointments/:id`.

*Last updated: September 2025 - Appointments E2E validated; frontend scheduler aligned; global validation enabled; DTOs updated; reports DTO fixed; seed script added.*

- Normalized service to match Prisma schema: removed direct `visit.branchId`, scoped by `patient.branchId`/`doctor.branchId`.
- Preserved API compatibility by returning computed `doctor.name` from `firstName`/`lastName`.
- Preserved top-level `notes` semantics by embedding in `plan` JSON and deriving `notes` in responses; search now scans `plan`.
- Enabled `ValidationPipe({ transform: true, whitelist: true })` in E2E app to mirror production validation.
- Fixed pagination types and `followUp` stats filter (`not: null`).

**Automated E2E Scenarios:**
- Create → Get → Update → Complete visit; statistics verified
- Minimal visit creation
- Patient visit history / Doctor visits
- Filters: date, patientId, doctorId
- Error handling: 400 invalid data, 404 patient/doctor/visit, 409 duplicate appointment
- Data validation: vitals ranges, complaints required, language enum
- Pagination and sorting
- Search by complaints and notes (via `plan`)

*Last updated: September 2025 - Visits E2E validated; service aligned with schema; compatibility maintained; validation and stats fixed.*

### September 2025: Appointments Conflict Handling & UI Alerts
**Achievement:** Enforced robust conflict detection with user-friendly UI feedback and test coverage.
**Impact:**
- Prevents double-booking of doctors and rooms by rejecting overlapping slots with 409 Conflict.
- Surfaces alternative time slots to receptionists for faster rebooking.
- Improves reliability for multi-user concurrent scheduling.

**Technical Highlights:**
- Backend: Conflict detection for both doctor and room using overlap check; returns `409` with `suggestions`.
  - Logic: `appointments.service.ts` uses `checkSchedulingConflicts` and `SchedulingUtils.doTimeSlotsOverlap`.
  - Available-slots endpoint merges doctor and room bookings for accurate availability.
- Frontend: `AppointmentScheduler.tsx` catches `409` and renders an alert with suggested alternative slots.
- Error handling: API client now throws enriched errors including `status` and `body` for precise UI messaging.

**Tests Added:**
- Backend (unit): `appointments.conflicts.service.spec.ts` — asserts 409 on overlapping doctor/room bookings and presence of `suggestions`.
- Backend (integration): `appointments.conflicts.integration.spec.ts` — asserts POST `/appointments` returns 409 for conflicts.
- Frontend (RTL): `AppointmentScheduler.conflict.test.tsx` — verifies alert shows suggested alternative slots on conflict.

**How to Verify:**
- Backend: `npm test -- src/modules/appointments/tests/appointments.conflicts.*.spec.ts`.
- Frontend: `npm test -- __tests__/appointments/AppointmentScheduler.conflict.test.tsx`.

*Last updated: September 2025 - Conflict prevention with suggestions; backend+frontend tests in place.*

---

### September 2025: Appointments Calendar View (Per-Doctor)
**Achievement:** Added daily calendar view per doctor with inline scheduling.
**Impact:**
- Receptionists can visualize a doctor's day as 30-minute slots and book directly from the calendar.
- Reduces booking errors and improves speed of scheduling.

**Technical Highlights:**
- New components: `AppointmentsCalendar.tsx`, `DoctorDayCalendar.tsx`.
- Tabs on `/dashboard/appointments`: switch between Calendar and Slots views.
- API client extended with `getDoctorSchedule(doctorId, date)`; wired to backend endpoint.
- Reuses existing conflict handling — UI surfaces suggestions on 409.

*Last updated: September 2025 - Calendar view available with direct booking.*

---

### September 2025: Notifications (Email & WhatsApp)
**Achievement:** Implemented outbound notifications for appointments via Email (SMTP) and WhatsApp (Meta Cloud API).
**Impact:**
- Patients receive confirmation upon appointment creation (summary with doctor, date, slot, token).
- Channel selection is automatic based on configuration; safe no-op when not configured.

**Technical Highlights:**
- New `NotificationsModule` with `NotificationsService` (SMTP using nodemailer, WhatsApp using WhatsApp Cloud API).
- Wired into `AppointmentsService.create` (fire-and-forget) after successful booking.
- Config via environment variables:
  - Email (SMTP): `SMTP_HOST`, `SMTP_PORT`, `SMTP_SECURE`, `SMTP_USER`, `SMTP_PASS`, `SMTP_FROM`
  - WhatsApp: `WHATSAPP_TOKEN`, `WHATSAPP_PHONE_NUMBER_ID`
- Graceful fallback when creds are absent; logs warn and continues without failing booking.

**Next Steps (optional):**
- Templated messages per language and visit type.
- Event-based notifications (reschedule, cancel, reminders, follow-up).
- Provider abstractions for SMS/Email/WhatsApp with failover.

*Last updated: September 2025 - Email/WhatsApp confirmations enabled on appointment creation.*

### September 2025: Billing Module Schema Alignment & Stabilization
**Achievement:** Aligned Billing module implementation with the current Prisma schema and stabilized all public endpoints.
**Impact:**
- Eliminated 500 errors from Billing endpoints by removing references to non-existent fields/relations.
- Billing lists, invoice retrieval, payments, summaries, revenue reports, and outstanding invoices now respond reliably.

**Technical Highlights:**
- Replaced unsupported fields/relations: removed includes for `visit`/`appointment`; swapped `invoiceNumber` -> `invoiceNo`, `totalAmount` -> `total`, `method` -> `mode`, `status` -> `reconStatus` (payments).
- Recomputed invoice balances using `received` and `balance`; outstanding invoices computed via `balance > 0`.
- Scoped queries by `patient.branchId` to enforce branch isolation consistently.
- Implemented `invoiceNo` generator (`INV-YYYYMMDD-###`) using latest invoice for the day.
- Disabled unsupported flows with explicit errors: invoice cancellation and refunds (absent in current schema).

**Endpoints working (schema-aligned):**
- `GET /billing/invoices` — list with pagination, search by `invoiceNo`/patient name
- `GET /billing/invoices/:id` — invoice detail with items, payments
- `POST /billing/invoices` — create invoice (items persisted as `invoice_items`)
- `POST /billing/payments` — add payment; updates invoice `received`/`balance`
- `POST /billing/payments/:id/confirm` — marks payment `reconStatus` as COMPLETED
- `GET /billing/payments` — list with filters (mode/status/date)
- `GET /billing/payments/summary` — totals, method and daily breakdowns
- `GET /billing/reports/revenue` — grouped revenue by day/week/month/year
- `GET /billing/invoices/outstanding` — invoices with `balance > 0`

**Known limitations (by design, current schema):**
- Invoice cancellation and refunds are not supported; endpoints return clear 400 errors.
- No doctor/category joins from invoice; reports derived from payments only.

**How to Verify:**
- Auth → `POST /auth/login` → use token on the billing endpoints above; expect 200s with empty data initially (no sample invoices/payments yet).

*Last updated: September 2025 - Billing module stabilized against current Prisma schema; unsupported flows disabled with explicit errors.*

### September 2025: Appointments Cancellation & Cash Refunds
**Achievement:** Enabled appointment cancellation via DELETE /appointments/:id and cash refunds in billing using negative payments.
**Impact:**
- Appointment cancellation prevents completed/in-progress cancellations and updates status to CANCELLED.
- Cash refunds recorded as negative payments; invoice received/balance adjusted accordingly.

**Technical Highlights:**
- `appointments.service.remove` enforces rules and sets `status: CANCELLED`.
- `billing.service.processRefund` validates completed payment then creates a negative payment and updates invoice aggregates.

*Last updated: September 2025 - Appointment cancellations and cash refunds implemented.*

### September 2025: Users Creation Flow & Patients Query Fix
**Achievement:** Fixed user creation validation by adding password input to UI and aligning backend DTOs; prevented undefined query params from breaking Patients list.
**Impact:**
- Users can now be created from the dashboard with password (validated 8–20 chars).
- Backend accepts `branchId` implicitly from the authenticated user when not provided in payload.
- Patients page no longer issues URLs like `/patients?search=undefined&gender=undefined`; undefined/empty params are omitted.

**Technical Highlights:**
- Frontend: `UsersManagement.tsx` now includes a password field for create-only and sends it to the API; client-side length validation added.
- Frontend: `api.ts` `get()` filters out undefined/null/empty values before constructing `URLSearchParams`.
- Backend: `CreateUserDto.branchId` made optional; `UsersService.createUser` defaults to `req.user.branchId`.

*Last updated: September 2025 - Users creation flow fixed; Patients query sanitized.*

**Achievement:** Added always-accessible Patient History tab on Visits page, seeded realistic visit history for a test patient, and resolved runtime/API errors.
**Impact:**
- Reception can instantly review a patient's chronological visit history with complaints, diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up.
- Reduced support load by fixing JSON parsing mismatches and Prisma query issues causing 500s.

**Technical Highlights:**
- Frontend: `PatientHistoryTimeline` added to `dashboard/visits`, renders medications as list items and handles parsed/string JSON fields safely.
- Frontend: `apiClient.getPatientVisitHistory` now reuses standard `get()` for headers/proxy.
- Backend: Seeded 5 dermatology visits for Rajesh Kumar; `getPatientVisitHistory` coerces `limit` to number; filters by `patient.branchId`.
- Backend: Reports service aligned with schema (`invoice` relation scoping, `mode`/`reconStatus` fields).

*Last updated: September 2025 - Patient history UI, seed data, and stability fixes completed.*

### September 2025: Prescription Builder, Drug DB Autocomplete, and Reports Stabilization
**Achievement:** Added a visit-linked Prescription Builder with dermatology-specific fields and robust print preview; introduced India-focused drug database with autocomplete; stabilized Reports service queries.
**Impact:**
- Doctors can compose rich dermatology prescriptions (topicals, steroid taper, isotretinoin mg/kg, warnings), toggle sections, and print in a clean A4 layout.
- Add-Drug bar powered by ingested dermatology drugs with fast autocomplete.
- Reports pages load reliably; revenue and payments reports aligned to current Prisma schema.

**Technical Highlights:**

## 2025-09-20 – Pharmacy Billing UX and Autocomplete Improvements

- Backend
  - Added `mode` to `DrugAutocompleteDto` ('name' | 'ingredient' | 'all') and implemented mode-aware ranking in `DrugService.autocomplete` (prefix > contains; name > composition > manufacturer > category).
  - Hardened query validation for numeric params (manual parsing for `limit`) to avoid class-transformer edge cases.
  - Normalized users listing response usage in frontend (handles `{users: [...]}`, `{data: [...]}`, and bare arrays).

- Frontend (PharmacyInvoiceBuilder)
  - Drug search: added search mode selector; debounced querying; smooth open/close of results (outside click + Escape; exit animation).
  - Patient: converted to autocomplete search (debounced, selectable, fills billing fields).
  - Doctor: kept as dropdown per app conventions; fixed population by normalizing users API response; `onValueChange` updates `doctorId`.

- Known/Follow-ups
  - Remove any stale references to `isOpen`/`invoiceId` if they reappear after hot reload (full Next restart clears stale chunks).
  - Add component tests for autocomplete ranking and dropdown population.
  - Unify API client typings to avoid `unknown` in component code.

## 2025-09-20 – Prescriptions Controller Parameter Order Fixes

**Achievement:** Fixed TypeScript linter errors in prescriptions controller by reordering method parameters.
**Impact:**
- Resolved 5 linter errors where optional parameters were followed by required parameters
- Improved code quality and TypeScript compliance
- Maintained all existing functionality while fixing parameter ordering

**Technical Highlights:**
- Fixed parameter order in `autocompleteField`, `getPatientPrescriptions`, `getPatientPrescriptionHistory`, `getDoctorPrescriptions`, and `cancelPrescription` methods
- Moved `@Request() req: AuthenticatedRequest` parameters before optional `@Query()` parameters
- Ensured TypeScript requirement that required parameters cannot follow optional ones
- No functional changes to API endpoints or business logic

[2025-09-21T03:23:10Z] Implemented: Move review date to end of visit form (updated MedicalVisitForm).
[2025-09-21T03:32:21Z] Implemented feature: Review Date moved to end of visit form and removed from PrescriptionBuilder. Visit completion now sends followUpDate. Updated components: MedicalVisitForm.tsx, PrescriptionBuilder.tsx.

### September 2025: Voice Transcription (Whisper) Integration Stabilized
**Achievement:** Backend speech-to-text endpoint stabilized; frontend mic input flows text into SOAP fields without errors.
**Impact:**
- Resolves 400 "Could not parse multipart form" and `form-data` stream errors.
- Doctors can reliably dictate notes; improved speed and accuracy in documentation.

**Technical Highlights:**
- Switched to Node 22 native `fetch`, `FormData`, and `Blob` in `VisitsController.transcribeAudio`.
- Removed `form-data` package usage (eliminated `DelayedStream` errors like `source.on is not a function`).
- Constructed multipart body with native `Blob([file.buffer], { type })`; appended via `form.append('file', blob, filename)`.
- Improved error logging with full stack traces; controller now returns `{ text: '' }` on failure instead of 500.
- Fixed backend `package.json` invalid trailing field breaking config, enabling clean start.
- Ensured `OPENAI_API_KEY` is single-line; restored `DATABASE_URL` in `.env` (not committed to git).

**Verification (logs):**
- `transcribeAudio: received file name=... size=... type=audio/webm`
- `transcribeAudio: sending audio to OpenAI Whisper`
- `transcribeAudio: OpenAI responded status=200`
- `transcribeAudio: transcript length=...`

**How to Use:**
- Frontend Visits page → press mic → speak 2–3 seconds → stop; text appends to active field (Subjective/Objective/Assessment/Plan).
- Backend endpoint: `POST /visits/transcribe` (multipart/form-data, field `file`).

*Last updated: September 2025 - Whisper transcription stabilized with native FormData/Blob; logging and env fixes applied.*

### September 2025: Immutable Audit Logging and Frontend Build Stabilization
**Achievement:** Added immutable audit logging across all database mutations and stabilized frontend build by typing API surfaces, fixing hook deps, and trimming warnings.
**Impact:**
- Regulatory-grade traceability for create/update/delete with who/when/what (before/after) and request metadata (IP, UA).
- Frontend builds pass reliably; reduced type errors and noisy warnings; improved developer throughput.

**Technical Highlights:**
- Backend
  - Introduced `RequestContextService` (AsyncLocalStorage) to carry `userId`, `ipAddress`, `userAgent` per request.
  - Registered global `RequestContextInterceptor` to populate context from `req.user`, `x-forwarded-for`/`req.ip`, and headers.
  - Implemented Prisma `$extends({ query })` audit middleware in `PrismaService` to log all mutating actions (create/update/upsert/delete, *Many variants) into `AuditLog`, skipping self-logging.
  - Captures: `entity`, `entityId`, `action`, `oldValues`, `newValues`, `userId`, `ipAddress`, `userAgent`, `timestamp`; sensitive fields redacted.
- Frontend
  - Typed multiple `ApiClient` methods (`getRooms`, `getRoomSchedule`, `getUsers`, `getPatients`, `getAvailableSlots`, `getDoctorSchedule`, `getAppointment`, `getPatientVisitHistory`, `getPrescription`, invoicing endpoints) to eliminate `unknown`.
  - Fixed implicit `any` in `Select`/`Tabs` handlers; escaped unescaped entities; adjusted optional fields and minimal types (e.g., `AppointmentInSlot.visit`, `doctor.id`).
  - Wrapped `/dashboard/visits` and `/login` pages in `React.Suspense` to satisfy Next.js CSR bailout rules; cleared ENOENT tmp manifest error by fresh build and cache cleanup.
  - Trimmed unused imports and tightened a few effects with `useCallback`/`useMemo` where appropriate.

**Next Steps:**
- Add export/reporting views for AuditLog with RBAC scoping and search by entity/date/user.
- Extend redaction list (e.g., tokens, PII) and consider per-entity field allowlists.
- Continue reducing lint warnings (hook deps, any types) and add CI to block regressions.

*Last updated: September 2025 - Audit logging enabled backend-wide; frontend stabilized and warnings reduced.*
