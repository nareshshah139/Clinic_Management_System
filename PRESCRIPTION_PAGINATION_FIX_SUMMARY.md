# Prescription Pagination Fix - Content Overflow to Next Page

## Problem
In the custom pagination engine, when prescription content exceeded the available page height, it was being **completely lost** due to `overflow: hidden` constraints. Users could navigate to page 2, 3, etc., but those pages would be empty or show nothing because the content was clipped.

## Solution
Modified the pagination system to allow content to flow naturally across multiple pages instead of being hidden.

## Key Changes

### 1. Preview Mode - Paginated View (`PrescriptionBuilder.tsx` lines 3161-3178)

**Before:**
- Content div had `maxHeight` constraint
- Content div had `overflow: hidden`
- Result: Content taller than one page was clipped and lost

**After:**
- Content div has `minHeight` (ensures at least one page height)
- No `maxHeight` constraint in paginated mode
- No `overflow: hidden` on content in paginated mode
- Content flows naturally to full height
- Parent container acts as viewport with overflow clipping

### 2. Print CSS (`PrescriptionBuilder.tsx` lines 2974-2982)

**Before:**
```css
max-height: calc(...) !important;
overflow: hidden !important;
```

**After:**
```css
min-height: calc(...) !important;
page-break-inside: auto !important;
```

## How It Works Now

### Paginated Preview
1. **Content renders at full height** - All prescription items, medications, instructions render completely
2. **Parent viewport has fixed height** - The `#prescription-print-root` container has fixed page height with `overflow: hidden`
3. **Navigation shifts content** - When you navigate to page 2, the content div shifts upward with negative `top` offset
4. **Viewport clips to show current page** - The parent's overflow clipping creates a "window" showing only the current page
5. **All pages have content** - Content that would be on page 2, 3, etc. is now visible when you navigate there

### Scroll Preview
- Unchanged - still uses `maxHeight` and `overflow: hidden` for traditional scrolling view

### Print Output
- Browser's native page-breaking handles multi-page content automatically
- `page-break-inside: auto` allows natural breaks
- Content flows across as many pages as needed
- Margins and background repeat on each printed page

## Testing Checklist

- [x] Create prescription with 3+ pages of content
- [x] Verify page navigation shows content on all pages (not empty)
- [x] Verify content doesn't overflow into margins
- [x] Verify smooth transition between pages
- [x] Verify print output spans multiple pages
- [x] Test with A4 and LETTER paper sizes
- [x] Test with different margin settings
- [x] Test scroll mode still works
- [x] No linter errors

## Benefits

✅ **Content is never lost** - Everything you add is visible on some page
✅ **Accurate page preview** - Preview matches actual print output
✅ **Intuitive pagination** - Navigate between pages to see all content
✅ **Flexible content** - Add as much content as needed, it flows naturally
✅ **Professional output** - Multi-page prescriptions work correctly

## Alternative: Paged.js

For users who need even more sophisticated pagination features, the **Paged.js** engine is also available:
- Toggle in the preview sidebar
- Automatic widow/orphan control
- Complex page layouts
- See `PAGEDJS_INTEGRATION.md` for details
