# Prescription Pagination Fix - Content Overflow to Next Page

## Problem
In the custom pagination engine, when prescription content exceeded the available page height, it was being **completely lost** due to `overflow: hidden` constraints. Users could navigate to page 2, 3, etc., but those pages would be empty or show nothing because the content was clipped.

## Solution
Modified the pagination system to allow content to flow naturally across multiple pages, with CSS masking to provide basic margin awareness.

## Key Changes

### 1. Preview Mode - Paginated View (`PrescriptionBuilder.tsx` lines 3131-3210)

**Before:**
- Content div had `maxHeight` constraint
- Content div had `overflow: hidden`
- Result: Content taller than one page was clipped and lost

**After:**
- Content div has `minHeight` for total pages
- Uses CSS `mask-image` with repeating pattern
- Content flows naturally
- Mask hides content in small gaps between pages (representing margins)
- Parent container acts as viewport with overflow clipping

### 2. Page Offset Calculation (lines 3148-3151)

**Updated to:**
```javascript
const availableHeightPerPage = pageHeightPx - topMarginPx - bottomMarginPx;
const pageOffset = -((currentPreviewPage - 1) * availableHeightPerPage);
```

Shifts content by available content height per page (excluding margins).

### 3. CSS Masking for Margin Awareness (lines 3168-3202)

**Added:**
```javascript
WebkitMaskImage: repeating-linear-gradient(
  to bottom,
  black 0px,                          // Visible
  black ${availableHeightPerPage}px,  // Content area
  transparent ${availableHeightPerPage}px,
  transparent ${availableHeightPerPage + 1}px  // Gap (margin)
)
```

Creates repeating pattern that shows content in valid areas and hides it in small gaps representing page margins.

### 4. UI Recommendation Notice (lines 3536-3542)

**Added:**
When using custom engine with 3+ pages, shows a recommendation:
```
üí° Recommendation
For documents with 3+ pages, consider using Paged.js for 
better margin awareness and page break control.
```

## How It Works Now

### Paginated Preview (Custom Engine)
1. **Content renders at full height** - minHeight set to accommodate all pages
2. **CSS mask applied** - Repeating pattern hides content in margin gaps
3. **Parent viewport has fixed height** - The `#prescription-print-root` container clips to page size
4. **Navigation shifts content** - Negative `top` offset for each page
5. **All pages accessible** - Content that flows to pages 2, 3, etc. is visible when navigating

### Limitations of Custom Engine

‚ö†Ô∏è **Margin awareness is limited** - Small 1px gaps between pages represent margins, but:
- Not as precise as true page-based layout
- Content near boundaries may touch margins
- No intelligent page break placement

‚úÖ **For best results with 3+ pages: Use Paged.js**

### Scroll Preview
- Unchanged - still uses `maxHeight` and `overflow: hidden` for traditional scrolling view

### Print Output
- Browser's native page-breaking handles multi-page content automatically
- `page-break-inside: auto` allows natural breaks
- Content flows across as many pages as needed

## Recommended Usage

| Scenario | Engine | Why |
|----------|--------|-----|
| 1-2 pages | Custom | Fast, simple |
| 3+ pages | **Paged.js** | Better margins, smart breaks |
| Complex tables/lists | **Paged.js** | Avoids mid-element breaks |
| Production printing | **Paged.js** | Professional output |
| Quick preview | Custom | Instant |

## Testing Checklist

- [x] Create prescription with 3+ pages of content
- [x] Verify page navigation shows content on all pages (not empty)
- [x] Verify content flows to subsequent pages
- [x] Verify basic margin separation between pages
- [x] Verify recommendation notice appears for 3+ pages
- [x] Test with A4 and LETTER paper sizes
- [x] Test with different margin settings
- [x] Test scroll mode still works
- [x] Test Paged.js for comparison
- [x] No linter errors

## Benefits

‚úÖ **Content is never lost** - Everything you add is visible on some page
‚úÖ **Page navigation works** - Navigate between pages to see all content
‚úÖ **Basic margin awareness** - CSS mask creates separation
‚úÖ **User guidance** - Recommends Paged.js for complex documents
‚úÖ **Flexible** - Users can choose the engine that works best

## Known Limitations

The custom engine is designed for simple cases:
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Margin gaps are minimal (1px visual separation)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è No intelligent page break placement
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Tables/lists can break mid-element
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Content near boundaries may touch margin areas

**For production multi-page documents**, we recommend **Paged.js**, which provides:
- ‚úÖ True margin-aware pagination
- ‚úÖ Smart page breaks (avoids breaking elements)
- ‚úÖ Widow/orphan control
- ‚úÖ W3C standards compliance
- ‚úÖ Professional publishing quality

## Alternative: Paged.js

Paged.js is fully integrated and available via toggle in the preview sidebar:
- Toggle in the right panel
- Processing time: ~300ms
- Perfect for 3+ page documents
- See `PAGEDJS_INTEGRATION.md` for details
- See `PRESCRIPTION_PAGINATION_LIMITATION.md` for comparison
