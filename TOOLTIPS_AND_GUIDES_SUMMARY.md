### For Developers

#### Using the QuickGuide Component

```tsx
import { QuickGuide } from '@/components/common/QuickGuide';

// Basic usage
<QuickGuide
  title="My Page Guide"
  sections={[
    {
      title: "Getting Started",
      items: [
        "Step 1: Do this first",
        "Step 2: Then do this",
        "Step 3: Finally, do this"
      ]
    },
    {
      title: "Advanced Features",
      items: [
        "Feature A: Description",
        "Feature B: Description"
      ]
    }
  ]}
/>

// Custom trigger button
<QuickGuide
  title="Custom Guide"
  triggerText="Help"
  triggerVariant="ghost"
  triggerClassName="my-custom-class"
  sections={[...]}
/>
```

#### Using the Tooltip Component

```tsx
import { Tooltip, TooltipContent, TooltipProvider, TooltipTrigger } from '@/components/ui/tooltip';

<TooltipProvider>
  <Tooltip>
    <TooltipTrigger>Hover me</TooltipTrigger>
    <TooltipContent>
      <p>This is a tooltip</p>
    </TooltipContent>
  </Tooltip>
</TooltipProvider>
```

#### Using the InfoTooltip Helper

```tsx
import { InfoTooltip } from '@/components/common/QuickGuide';

<InfoTooltip content="This field is required">
  <span>Field Label *</span>
</InfoTooltip>
```

## Installation Requirements

The following package was added to support tooltips:
```bash
npm install @radix-ui/react-tooltip
```

This package is now included in `package.json` and will be automatically installed with `npm install`.

## Design Decisions

1. **Consistency**: All guides follow the same visual and interaction pattern
2. **Context-Sensitive**: Each guide is tailored to the specific page's functionality
3. **Non-Intrusive**: Guides are optional and don't block the UI
4. **Accessible**: Uses proper ARIA labels and keyboard navigation
5. **Responsive**: Works on mobile, tablet, and desktop screens

## Benefits

1. **Improved Onboarding**: New users can quickly understand how to use each page
2. **Reduced Training Time**: Staff can reference guides instead of asking for help
3. **Better UX**: Users feel confident using the system with built-in help
4. **Documentation**: Guides serve as inline documentation
5. **Consistency**: Standardized help across all pages

## Future Enhancements

Consider these potential improvements:

1. **Video Tutorials**: Add video walkthroughs to guides
2. **Interactive Tours**: Step-by-step walkthroughs with highlights
3. **Search**: Add search functionality within guides
4. **Contextual Help**: Show relevant guide sections based on user actions
5. **Multi-language Support**: Translate guides to multiple languages
6. **Analytics**: Track which guides are most used to improve documentation

- The QuickGuide component is reusable and can be easily added to new pages
