# Visits Module - E2E Test Scenarios and Results

Date: 2025-09-07
Runner: Jest (Node)
Scope: backend/src/modules/visits/tests/visits.e2e.spec.ts

## Summary
- Suites: 1 passed / 1 total
- Tests: 17 passed / 17 total
- Time: ~1.1s

## Scenarios

### Complete Visit Workflow
1. Create, retrieve, update, and complete a visit successfully
   - Create visit with vitals, complaints, exam, diagnosis, treatment plan, and notes
   - Retrieve visit and validate parsed JSON fields and computed doctor name
   - Update visit vitals/notes; confirm persistence in plan JSON and top-level `notes` derived field
   - Complete visit with final notes and follow-up; appointment status transitions to COMPLETED
   - Get statistics; totals are consistent
   - Result: PASSED

2. Handle visit creation with minimal required data
   - Create visit with only patientId, doctorId, and complaints
   - Result: PASSED

3. Retrieve patient visit history
   - Validates visit list and JSON parsing
   - Result: PASSED

4. Retrieve doctor visits
   - Validates scoping by doctor and computed doctor name
   - Result: PASSED

5. Filter by parameters (date, patientId, doctorId)
   - Validates pagination and filtering behavior
   - Result: PASSED

### Error Handling
6. 400 for invalid visit data
   - Invalid vitals and structure rejected by ValidationPipe/service
   - Result: PASSED

7. 404 for non-existent patient
   - Patient not in branch or missing
   - Result: PASSED

8. 404 for non-existent doctor
   - Doctor not in branch or missing
   - Result: PASSED

9. 404 for non-existent visit
   - Invalid visit ID
   - Result: PASSED

10. 409 for duplicate visit on same appointment
    - First visit created; second for same appointment rejected
    - Result: PASSED

### Data Validation
11. Validate vitals ranges
    - Out-of-range vitals rejected
    - Result: PASSED

12. Validate required complaint field
    - Empty complaints rejected
    - Result: PASSED

13. Validate language enum
    - Invalid language value rejected
    - Result: PASSED

### Pagination and Sorting
14. Paginate visits correctly
    - Page/limit respected; count correct
    - Result: PASSED

15. Sort visits by different fields
    - Sorting consistency verified on createdAt
    - Result: PASSED

### Search Functionality
16. Search by complaint text
    - Matches text inside complaints JSON
    - Result: PASSED

17. Search by notes
    - Matches text inside plan JSON (`notes`/`finalNotes`), preserving notes feature
    - Result: PASSED

## Implementation Notes
- Branch scoping is enforced via related `patient.branchId`/`doctor.branchId` (no direct `visit.branchId`).
- Doctor name is returned as a computed field from `firstName`/`lastName` to keep API compatibility.
- Top-level `notes` are preserved by embedding into `plan` JSON and deriving `notes` in responses.
- Validation enforced with NestJS `ValidationPipe` in the E2E app setup.

## Next Steps
- Optional: Add more field-level search (exam/history) and additional sort fields.
- Optional: Add E2E coverage for follow-up reminders integration and prescription linkage.
